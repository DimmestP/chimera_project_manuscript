   abstract = {The stability of mRNA is one of the major determinants of gene expression. Although a wealth of sequence elements regulating mRNA stability has been described, their quantitative contributions to half-life are unknown. Here, we built a quantitative model for Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on functional mRNA sequence features that explains 59% of the half-life variation between genes and predicts half-life at a median relative error of 30%. The model revealed a new destabilizing 3′′ UTR motif, ATATTC, which we functionally validated. Codon usage proves to be the major determinant of mRNA stability. Nonetheless, single-nucleotide variations have the largest effect when occurring on 3′′ UTR motifs or upstream AUGs. Analyzing mRNA half-life data of 34 knockout strains showed that the effect of codon usage not only requires functional decapping and deadenylation, but also the 5′′-to-3′′ exonuclease Xrn1, the nonsense-mediated decay genes, but not no-go decay. Altogether, this study quantitatively delineates the contributions of mRNA sequence features on stability in yeast, reveals their functional dependencies on degradation pathways, and allows accurate prediction of half-life from mRNA sequence.},

Here we present cDTA data for 46 yeast strains lacking genes involved in mRNA degradation and metabolism. In these strains, changes in mRNA degradation rates are generally compensated by changes in mRNA synthesis rates, resulting in a buffering of mRNA levels. We show that buffering of mRNA levels requires the RNA exonuclease Xrn1. The buffering is rapidly established when mRNA synthesis is impaired, but is delayed when mRNA degradation is impaired, apparently due to Xrn1-dependent transcription repressor induction. Cluster analysis of the data defines the general mRNA degradation machinery, reveals different substrate preferences for the two mRNA deadenylase complexes Ccr4-Not and Pan2-Pan3, and unveils an interwoven cellular mRNA surveillance network. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {E2F transcription factors are important regulators of cell proliferation and are frequently dysregulated in human malignancies. To identify novel regulators of E2F function, we used Drosophila as a model system to screen for mutations that modify phenotypes caused by reduced levels of dE2F1. This screen identified components of the Pumilio translational repressor complex (Pumilio, Nanos, and Brain tumor) as suppressors of dE2F1-RNAi phenotypes. Subsequent experiments provided evidence that Pumilio complexes repress dE2F1 levels and that this mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation is conserved in human cells. The human Pumilio homologs Pum 1 and Pum 2 repress the translation of E2F3 by binding to the E2F3 39 untranslated region (UTR) and also enhance the activity of multiple E2F3 targeting microRNAs (miRNAs). E2F3 is an oncogene with strong proliferative potential and is regularly dysregulated or overexpressed in cancer. Interestingly, Pumilio/miRNA-mediated regulation of E2F3 is circumvented in cancer cells in several different ways. Bladder carcinomas selectively down-regulate miRNAs that cooperate with Pumilio to target E2F3, and multiple tumor cell lines shorten the 39 end of the E2F3 mRNA, removing the Pumilio regulatory elements. These studies suggest that Pumilio-miRNA repression of E2F3 translation provides an important level of E2F regulation that is frequently abrogated in cancer cells. © 2012 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

Physical association and computational analyses of yeast Puf3p identified >150 potential mRNA targets involved in mitochondrial function. However, only COX17 has been established as a target of Puf3pmediated deadenylation and decapping. We have identified 10 new targets that are rapidly degraded in a Puf3p-dependent manner. We also observed changes in Puf3p activity in response to environmental conditions. Puf3p promotes rapid degradation of mRNA targets in the fermentable carbon source dextrose. However, Puf3p-mediated decay activity is inhibited in carbon sources that require mitochondrial function for efficient cell growth. In addition, the activity of Puf3p is rapidly altered by changing the carbon source. PUF3 expression is not decreased at the RNA or protein level by different carbon sources and localization is not significantly altered, suggesting that Puf3p activity is regulated posttranslationally. Finally, under conditions when Puf3p is unable to stimulate decay, Puf3p can still bind its target mRNAs. Together, these experiments provide insight into the carbon source-specific control of Puf3p activity and how such alterations allow Puf3p to dynamically regulate mitochondrial function.© The Author(s) 2014.

The lin-14 3′UTR is both necessary and sufficient to confer lin-4-mediated posttranscriptional temporal regulation. The function of the lin-14 3′UTR is conserved between C. elegans and C. briggsae.

Here we show that let-7 is a heterochronic switch gene. Loss of let-7 gene activity causes reiteration of larval cell fates during the adult stage, whereas increased let-7 gene dosage causes precocious expression of adult fates during larval stages. let-7 encodes a temporally regulated 21- nucleotide RNA that is complementary to elements in the 3' untranslated regions of the heterochronic genes lin-14, lin-28, lin-41, lin-42 and daf- 12, indicating that expression of these genes may be directly controlled by let-7.

A second regulatory RNA, lin-4, negatively regulates lin-14 and lin-28 through RNA-RNA interactions with their 3' untranslated regions.

   abstract = {Approximately 1500 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) profoundly impact mammalian cellular function by controlling distinct sets of transcripts, often using sequence-specific binding to 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) to regulate mRNA stability and translation. Aside from their individual effects, higher-order combinatorial interactions between RBPs on specific mRNAs have been proposed to underpin the regulatory network. To assess the extent of such co-regulatory control, we took a global experimental approach followed by targeted validation to examine interactions between two well-characterized and highly conserved RBPs, Argonaute2 (AGO2) and Pumilio (PUM1 and PUM2). Transcriptome-wide changes in AGO2-mRNA binding upon PUM knockdown were quantified by CLIP-seq, and the presence of PUM binding on the same 3′UTR corresponded with cooperative and antagonistic effects on AGO2 occupancy. In addition, PUM binding sites that overlap with AGO2 showed differential, weakened binding profiles upon abrogation of AGO2 association, indicative of cooperative interactions. In luciferase reporter validation of candidate 3′UTR sites where AGO2 and PUM colocalized, three sites were identified to host antagonistic interactions, where PUM counteracts miRNA-guided repression. Interestingly, the binding sites for the two proteins are too far for potential antagonism due to steric hindrance, suggesting an alternate mechanism. Our data experimentally confirms the combinatorial regulatory model and indicates that the mostly repressive PUM proteins can change their behavior in a context-dependent manner. Overall, the approach underscores the importance of further elucidation of complex interactions between RBPs and their transcriptome-wide extent.},

The localization of these transcripts depends on interactions between a cis -acting localization element(s) or zipcodes and the RNA-binding protein She2p. While previous studies identified four different localization elements in the bud-localized ASH1 mRNA, the main determinants for She2p recognition are still unknown. To investigate the RNA-binding specificity of She2p, we isolated She2p-binding RNAs by in vivo selection from libraries of partially randomized ASH1 localization elements. The RNAs isolated contained a similar loop-stem-loop structure with a highly conserved CGA triplet in one loop and a single conserved cytosine in the other loop. Mutating these conserved nucleotides or the stem separating them resulted in the loss of She2p binding and in the delocalization of a reporter mRNA. Using this information, we identified the same RNA motif in two other known bud-localized transcripts, suggesting that this motif is conserved among bud-localized mRNAs. These results show that mRNAs with zipcodes lacking primary sequence similarity can rely on a few conserved nucleotides properly oriented in their three-dimensional structure in order to be recognized by the same localization machinery. },

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae, silencing of ASH1 mRNA before it is localized to the bud cortex in late anaphase is critical for asymmetric segregation of Ash1p to the daughter cell nucleus. Puf6p, an ASH1 mRNA-binding protein, has been implicated in this process as a translational repressor, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we used yeast extract-based in vitro translation assays, which recapitulate translation and phosphorylation, to characterize the mechanism of Puf6p-mediated translational regulation. We report that Puf6p interferes with the conversion of the 48S complex to the 80S complex during initiation, and this repression by Puf6p is mediated through the general translation factor eIF5B (Fun12p in S. cerevisiae). Puf6p interacts with Fun12p via the PUF domain, and this interaction is RNA-dependent and essential for translational repression by Puf6p. This repression is relieved by phosphorylation of the N-terminal region of Puf6p mediated by protein kinase CK2 (casein kinase II). Inhibition of phosphorylation at Ser31, Ser34, and Ser35 of Puf6p increases its translational repression and results in ASH1 mRNA delocalization. Our results indicate that Puf6p suppresses the translation initiation of ASH1 mRNA via interaction with Fun12p during its transport, and this repression can be released by CK2 phosphorylation in the N-terminal region of Puf6p when the mRNA reaches the bud tip. © 2008 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

The yeast genome displays unusually dense transcript spacing, with interleaved and overlapping transcription from both strands, resulting in a minuscule but complex pool of RNA that is protected by a resilient cell wall. Here, we have developed a sensitive, scalable and inexpensive yeast single-cell RNA-seq (yscRNA-seq) method that digitally counts transcript start sites in a strand- and isoform-specific manner. YscRNA-seq detects the expression of low-abundance, noncoding RNAs and at least half of the protein-coding genome in each cell. In clonal cells, we observed a negative correlation for the expression of sense–antisense pairs, whereas paralogs and divergent transcripts co-expressed. By combining yscRNA-seq with index sorting, we uncovered a linear relationship between cell size and RNA content. Although we detected an average of ~3.5 molecules per gene, the number of expressed isoforms is restricted at the single-cell level. Remarkably, the expression of metabolic genes is highly variable, whereas their stochastic expression primes cells for increased fitness towards the corresponding environmental challenge. These findings suggest that functional transcript diversity acts as a mechanism that provides a selective advantage to individual cells within otherwise transcriptionally heterogeneous populations.},

   abstract = {mRNA degradation represents a critical regulated step in gene expression. Although the major pathways in turnover have been identified, accounting for disparate half-lives has been elusive. We show that codon optimality is one feature that contributes greatly to mRNA stability. Genome-wide RNA decay analysis revealed that stable mRNAs are enriched in codons designated optimal, whereas unstable mRNAs contain predominately non-optimal codons. Substitution of optimal codons with synonymous, non-optimal codons results in dramatic mRNA destabilization, whereas the converse substitution significantly increases stability. Further, we demonstrate that codon optimality impacts ribosome translocation, connecting the processes of translation elongation and decay through codon optimality. Finally, we show that optimal codon content accounts for the similar stabilities observed in mRNAs encoding proteins with coordinated physiological function. This work demonstrates that codon optimization exists as a mechanism to finely tune levels of mRNAs and, ultimately, proteins.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ash1p is a specific repressor of transcription that localizes exclusively to daughter cell nuclei through the asymmetric localization of ASH1 mRNA. This localization requires four cis-acting localization elements located in the ASH1 mRNA, five trans-acting factors, one of which is a myosin, and the actin cytoskeleton. The RNA-binding proteins that interact with these cis-elements remained to be identified. Starting with the 3′ most localization element of ASH1 mRNA in the three-hybrid assay, element E3, we isolated a clone corresponding to the C-terminus of She3p. We also found that She3p and She2p interact, and this interaction is essential for the binding of She3p with element E3 in vivo. Moreover, She2p was observed to bind the E3 RNA directly in vitro and each of the ASH1 cis-acting localization elements requires She2p for their localization function. By tethering a She3p–MS2 fusion protein to a reporter RNA containing MS2 binding sites, we observed that She2p is dispensable for She3p–MS2-dependent RNA localization.},

   abstract = {Transcript function is determined by sequence elements arranged on an individual RNA molecule. Variation in transcripts can affect messenger RNA stability, localization and translation, or produce truncated proteins that differ in localization or function. Given the existence of overlapping, variable transcript isoforms, determining the functional impact of the transcriptome requires identification of full-length transcripts, rather than just the genomic regions that are transcribed. Here, by jointly determining both transcript ends for millions of RNA molecules, we reveal an extensive layer of isoform diversity previously hidden among overlapping RNA molecules. Variation in transcript boundaries seems to be the rule rather than the exception, even within a single population of yeast cells. Over 26 major transcript isoforms per protein-coding gene were expressed in yeast. Hundreds of short coding RNAs and truncated versions of proteins are concomitantly encoded by alternative transcript isoforms, increasing protein diversity. In addition, approximately 70% of genes express alternative isoforms that vary in post-transcriptional regulatory elements, and tandem genes frequently produce overlapping or even bicistronic transcripts. This extensive transcript diversity is generated by a relatively simple eukaryotic genome with limited splicing, and within a genetically homogeneous population of cells. Our findings have implications for genome compaction, evolution and phenotypic diversity between single cells. These data also indicate that isoform diversity as well as RNA abundance should be considered when assessing the functional repertoire of genomes. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, intensive computational efforts have been directed towards the discovery of promoter motifs that correlate with mRNA expression profiles. Nevertheless, it is still not always possible to predict steady-state mRNA expression levels based on promoter signals alone, suggesting that other factors may be involved. Other genic regions, in particular 3' UTRs, which are known to exert regulatory effects especially through controlling RNA stability and localization, were less comprehensively investigated, and deciphering regulatory motifs within them is thus crucial. RESULTS: By analyzing 3' UTR sequences and mRNA decay profiles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, we derived a catalog of 53 sequence motifs that may be implicated in stabilization or destabilization of mRNAs. Some of the motifs correspond to known RNA-binding protein sites, and one of them may act in destabilization of ribosome biogenesis genes during stress response. In addition, we present for the first time a catalog of 23 motifs associated with subcellular localization. A significant proportion of the 3' UTR motifs is highly conserved in orthologous yeast genes, and some of the motifs are strikingly similar to recently published mammalian 3' UTR motifs. We classified all genes into those regulated only at transcription initiation level, only at degradation level, and those regulated by a combination of both. Interestingly, different biological functionalities and expression patterns correspond to such classification. CONCLUSION: The present motif catalogs are a first step towards the understanding of the regulation of mRNA degradation and subcellular localization, two important processes which--together with transcription regulation--determine the cell transcriptome.},

   abstract = {The terminator regions of eukaryotes encode functional elements in the 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR) that influence the 3′-end processing of mRNA, mRNA stability, and translational efficiency, which can modulate protein production. However, the contribution of these terminator regions to gene expression remains unclear, and therefore their utilization in metabolic engineering or synthetic genetic circuits has been limited. Here, we comprehensively evaluated the activity of 5302 terminator regions from a total of 5880 genes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by inserting each terminator region downstream of the PTDH3- green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene and measuring the fluorescent intensity of GFP. Terminator region activities relative to that of the PGK1 standard terminator ranged from 0.036 to 2.52, with a mean of 0.87. We thus could isolate the most and least active terminator regions. The activities of the terminator regions showed a positive correlation with mRNA abundance, indicating that the terminator region is a determinant of mRNA abundance. The least active terminator regions tended to encode longer 3′-UTRs, suggesting the existence of active degradation mechanisms for those mRNAs. The terminator regions of ribosomal protein genes tended to be the most active, suggesting the existence of a common regulator of those genes. The ″terminatome″ (the genome-wide set of terminator regions) thus not only provides valuable information to understand the modulatory roles of terminator regions on gene expression but also serves as a useful toolbox for the development of metabolically and genetically engineered yeast. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Control of gene and protein expression of both endogenous and heterologous genes is a key component of metabolic engineering. While a large amount of work has been published characterizing promoters for this purpose, less effort has been exerted to elucidate the role of terminators in yeast. In this study, we characterize over 30 terminators for use in metabolic engineering applications in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determine mRNA half-life changes to be the major cause of the varied protein and transcript expression level. We demonstrate that the difference in transcript level can be over 6.5-fold even for high strength promoters. The influence of terminator selection is magnified when coupled with a low-expression promoter, with a maximum difference in protein expression of 11-fold between an expression-enhancing terminator and the parent plasmid terminator and over 35-fold difference when compared with a no-terminator baseline. This is the first time that terminators have been investigated in the context of multiple promoters spanning orders of magnitude in activity. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of terminator selection for metabolic engineering by using a mutant xylose isomerase gene as a proof-of-concept. Through pairing an expression-enhancing terminator with a low-expression promoter, we were able to achieve the same phenotypic result as with a promoter considerably higher in strength. Moreover, we can further boost the phenotype of the high-strength promoter by pairing it with an expression-enhancing terminator. This work highlights how terminator elements can be used to control metabolic pathways in the same way that promoters are traditionally used in yeast. Together, this work demonstrates that terminators will be an important part of heterologous gene expression and metabolic engineering for yeast in the future. © 2013 Elsevier Inc..},

   abstract = {The U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) plays an essential role in ribosome biogenesis but, like many RNA-protein complexes, its architecture is poorly understood. To address this problem, binding sites for the snoRNP proteins Nop1, Nop56, Nop58, and Rrp9 were mapped by UV cross-linking and analysis of cDNAs. Cross-linked protein-RNA complexes were purified under highly-denaturing conditions, ensuring that only direct interactions were detected. Recovered RNA fragments were amplified after linker ligation and cDNA synthesis. Cross-linking was successfully performed either in vitro on purified complexes or in vivo in living cells. Cross-linking sites were precisely mapped either by Sanger sequencing of multiple cloned fragments or direct, high-throughput Solexa sequencing. Analysis of RNAs associated with the snoRNP proteins revealed remarkably high signal-to-noise ratios and identified specific binding sites for each of these proteins on the U3 RNA. The results were consistent with previous data, demonstrating the reliability of the method, but also provided insights into the architecture of the U3 snoRNP. The snoRNP proteins were also cross-linked to pre-rRNA fragments, with preferential association at known sites of box C/D snoRNA function. This finding demonstrates that the snoRNP proteins directly contact the pre-rRNA substrate, suggesting roles in snoRNA recruitment. The techniques reported here should be widely applicable to analyses of RNA-protein interactions.},

Advances in sequencing-based assays have enabled investigation of these processes genome-wide, leading to large datasets that combine information on the dynamics of gene expression, transcription factor binding and chromatin structure as cells differentiate. While numerous studies focus on the effects of these features on broader gene regulation, less work has been done on the mechanisms of gene-specific transcriptional control. In this study, we have focussed on the latter by integrating gene expression data for the in vitro differentiation of murine ES cells to macrophages and cardiomyocytes, with dynamic data on chromatin structure, epigenetics and transcription factor binding. Combining a novel strategy to identify communities of related control elements with a penalized regression approach, we developed individual models to identify the potential control elements predictive of the expression of each gene. Our models were compared to an existing method and evaluated using the existing literature and new experimental data from embryonic stem cell differentiation reporter assays. Our method is able to identify transcriptional control elements in a gene specific manner that reflect known regulatory relationships and to generate useful hypotheses for further testing.},
