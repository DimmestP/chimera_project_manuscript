   abstract = {The stability of {mRNA} is one of the major determinants of gene expression. Although a wealth of sequence elements regulating {mRNA} stability has been described, their quantitative contributions to half-life are unknown. Here, we built a quantitative model for Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on functional {mRNA} sequence features that explains 59% of the half-life variation between genes and predicts half-life at a median relative error of 30%. The model revealed a new destabilizing 3′′ UTR motif, ATATTC, which we functionally validated. Codon usage proves to be the major determinant of {mRNA} stability. Nonetheless, single-nucleotide variations have the largest effect when occurring on 3′′ UTR motifs or upstream AUGs. Analyzing {mRNA} half-life data of 34 knockout strains showed that the effect of codon usage not only requires functional decapping and deadenylation, but also the 5′′-to-3′′ exonuclease Xrn1, the nonsense-mediated decay genes, but not no-go decay. Altogether, this study quantitatively delineates the contributions of {mRNA} sequence features on stability in yeast, reveals their functional dependencies on degradation pathways, and allows accurate prediction of half-life from {mRNA} sequence.},

   abstract = {Yeast cells undergoing the diauxic response show a striking upstream shift in poly(A) site utilization, with increased use of ORF-proximal poly(A) sites resulting in shorter 3’ {mRNA} isoforms for most genes. This altered poly(A) pattern is extremely similar to that observed in cells containing Pol II derivatives with slow elongation rates. Conversely, cells containing derivatives with fast elongation rates show a subtle downstream shift in poly(A) sites. Polyadenylation patterns of many genes are sensitive to both fast and slow elongation rates, and a global shift of poly(A) utilization is strongly linked to increased purine content of sequences flanking poly(A) sites. Pol II processivity is impaired in diauxic cells, but strains with reduced processivity and normal Pol II elongation rates have normal polyadenylation profiles. Thus, Pol II elongation speed is important for poly(A) site selection and for regulating poly(A) patterns in response to environmental conditions.},

   abstract = {E2F transcription factors are important regulators of cell proliferation and are frequently dysregulated in human malignancies. To identify novel regulators of E2F function, we used Drosophila as a model system to screen for mutations that modify phenotypes caused by reduced levels of dE2F1. This screen identified components of the Pumilio translational repressor complex (Pumilio, Nanos, and Brain tumor) as suppressors of dE2F1-RNAi phenotypes. Subsequent experiments provided evidence that Pumilio complexes repress dE2F1 levels and that this mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation is conserved in human cells. The human Pumilio homologs Pum 1 and Pum 2 repress the translation of E2F3 by binding to the E2F3 39 untranslated region (UTR) and also enhance the activity of multiple E2F3 targeting microRNAs (miRNAs). E2F3 is an oncogene with strong proliferative potential and is regularly dysregulated or overexpressed in cancer. Interestingly, Pumilio/miRNA-mediated regulation of E2F3 is circumvented in cancer cells in several different ways. Bladder carcinomas selectively down-regulate miRNAs that cooperate with Pumilio to target E2F3, and multiple tumor cell lines shorten the 39 end of the E2F3 {mRNA}, removing the Pumilio regulatory elements. These studies suggest that Pumilio-miRNA repression of E2F3 translation provides an important level of E2F regulation that is frequently abrogated in cancer cells. © 2012 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

Physical association and computational analyses of yeast Puf3p identified >150 potential {mRNA} targets involved in mitochondrial function. However, only COX17 has been established as a target of Puf3pmediated deadenylation and decapping. We have identified 10 new targets that are rapidly degraded in a Puf3p-dependent manner. We also observed changes in Puf3p activity in response to environmental conditions. Puf3p promotes rapid degradation of {mRNA} targets in the fermentable carbon source dextrose. However, Puf3p-mediated decay activity is inhibited in carbon sources that require mitochondrial function for efficient cell growth. In addition, the activity of Puf3p is rapidly altered by changing the carbon source. PUF3 expression is not decreased at the RNA or protein level by different carbon sources and localization is not significantly altered, suggesting that Puf3p activity is regulated posttranslationally. Finally, under conditions when Puf3p is unable to stimulate decay, Puf3p can still bind its target {mRNA}s. Together, these experiments provide insight into the carbon source-specific control of Puf3p activity and how such alterations allow Puf3p to dynamically regulate mitochondrial function.© The Author(s) 2014.

Here we demonstrate that a temporal gradient in Lin-14 protein is generated posttranscriptionally by multiple elements in the lin-14 3′UTR that are regulated by the heterochronic gene Lin-4. The lin-14 3′UTR is both necessary and sufficient to confer lin-4-mediated posttranscriptional temporal regulation. The function of the lin-14 3′UTR is conserved between C. elegans and C. briggsae. Among the conserved sequences are seven elements that are each complementary to the lin-4 RNAs. A reporter gene bearing three of these elements shows partial temporal gradient activity.

Mutations in heterochronic timing of developmental genes cause temporal transformations in cell fates in which stage-specific events are omitted or reiterated. Here we show that let-7 is a heterochronic switch gene. Loss of let-7 gene activity causes reiteration of larval cell fates during the adult stage, whereas increased let-7 gene dosage causes precocious expression of adult fates during larval stages. let-7 encodes a temporally regulated 21- nucleotide RNA that is complementary to elements in the 3' untranslated regions of the heterochronic genes lin-14, lin-28, lin-41, lin-42 and daf- 12, indicating that expression of these genes may be directly controlled by let-7. A reporter gene bearing the lin-41 3' untranslated region is temporally regulated in a let-7-dependent manner. A second regulatory RNA, lin-4, negatively regulates lin-14 and lin-28 through RNA-RNA interactions with their 3' untranslated regions.

   abstract = {Approximately 1500 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) profoundly impact mammalian cellular function by controlling distinct sets of transcripts, often using sequence-specific binding to 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) to regulate {mRNA} stability and translation. Aside from their individual effects, higher-order combinatorial interactions between RBPs on specific {mRNA}s have been proposed to underpin the regulatory network. To assess the extent of such co-regulatory control, we took a global experimental approach followed by targeted validation to examine interactions between two well-characterized and highly conserved RBPs, Argonaute2 (AGO2) and Pumilio (PUM1 and PUM2). Transcriptome-wide changes in AGO2-{mRNA} binding upon PUM knockdown were quantified by CLIP-seq, and the presence of PUM binding on the same 3′UTR corresponded with cooperative and antagonistic effects on AGO2 occupancy. In addition, PUM binding sites that overlap with AGO2 showed differential, weakened binding profiles upon abrogation of AGO2 association, indicative of cooperative interactions. In luciferase reporter validation of candidate 3′UTR sites where AGO2 and PUM colocalized, three sites were identified to host antagonistic interactions, where PUM counteracts miRNA-guided repression. Interestingly, the binding sites for the two proteins are too far for potential antagonism due to steric hindrance, suggesting an alternate mechanism. Our data experimentally confirms the combinatorial regulatory model and indicates that the mostly repressive PUM proteins can change their behavior in a context-dependent manner. Overall, the approach underscores the importance of further elucidation of complex interactions between RBPs and their transcriptome-wide extent.},

The localization of these transcripts depends on interactions between a cis -acting localization element(s) or zipcodes and the RNA-binding protein She2p. While previous studies identified four different localization elements in the bud-localized ASH1 {mRNA}, the main determinants for She2p recognition are still unknown. To investigate the RNA-binding specificity of She2p, we isolated She2p-binding RNAs by in vivo selection from libraries of partially randomized ASH1 localization elements. The RNAs isolated contained a similar loop-stem-loop structure with a highly conserved CGA triplet in one loop and a single conserved cytosine in the other loop. Mutating these conserved nucleotides or the stem separating them resulted in the loss of She2p binding and in the delocalization of a reporter {mRNA}. Using this information, we identified the same RNA motif in two other known bud-localized transcripts, suggesting that this motif is conserved among bud-localized {mRNA}s. These results show that {mRNA}s with zipcodes lacking primary sequence similarity can rely on a few conserved nucleotides properly oriented in their three-dimensional structure in order to be recognized by the same localization machinery. },

   abstract = {Translational repression during {mRNA} transport is essential for spatial restriction of protein production. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae, silencing of ASH1 {mRNA} before it is localized to the bud cortex in late anaphase is critical for asymmetric segregation of Ash1p to the daughter cell nucleus. Puf6p, an ASH1 {mRNA}-binding protein, has been implicated in this process as a translational repressor, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we used yeast extract-based in vitro translation assays, which recapitulate translation and phosphorylation, to characterize the mechanism of Puf6p-mediated translational regulation. We report that Puf6p interferes with the conversion of the 48S complex to the 80S complex during initiation, and this repression by Puf6p is mediated through the general translation factor eIF5B (Fun12p in S. cerevisiae). Puf6p interacts with Fun12p via the PUF domain, and this interaction is RNA-dependent and essential for translational repression by Puf6p. This repression is relieved by phosphorylation of the N-terminal region of Puf6p mediated by protein kinase CK2 (casein kinase II). Inhibition of phosphorylation at Ser31, Ser34, and Ser35 of Puf6p increases its translational repression and results in ASH1 {mRNA} delocalization. Our results indicate that Puf6p suppresses the translation initiation of ASH1 {mRNA} via interaction with Fun12p during its transport, and this repression can be released by CK2 phosphorylation in the N-terminal region of Puf6p when the {mRNA} reaches the bud tip. © 2008 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

Based on carefully measured thermodynamic parameters, exact dynamic programming algorithms can be used to compute ground states, base pairing probabilities, as well as thermodynamic properties.Results: The ViennaRNA Package has been a widely used compilation of RNA secondary structure related computer programs for nearly two decades. Major changes in the structure of the standard energy model, the Turner 2004 parameters, the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs, and an increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a major technical overhaul of both the underlying RNAlib and the interactive user programs. New features include an expanded repertoire of tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles of structures, additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures derived from base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally stable secondary structures, and support for input in fasta format.

   abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed extensive cellular heterogeneity within many organisms, but few methods have been developed for microbial clonal populations. The yeast genome displays unusually dense transcript spacing, with interleaved and overlapping transcription from both strands, resulting in a minuscule but complex pool of RNA that is protected by a resilient cell wall. Here, we have developed a sensitive, scalable and inexpensive yeast single-cell RNA-seq (yscRNA-seq) method that digitally counts transcript start sites in a strand- and isoform-specific manner. YscRNA-seq detects the expression of low-abundance, noncoding RNAs and at least half of the protein-coding genome in each cell. In clonal cells, we observed a negative correlation for the expression of sense–antisense pairs, whereas paralogs and divergent transcripts co-expressed. By combining yscRNA-seq with index sorting, we uncovered a linear relationship between cell size and RNA content. Although we detected an average of ~3.5 molecules per gene, the number of expressed isoforms is restricted at the single-cell level. Remarkably, the expression of metabolic genes is highly variable, whereas their stochastic expression primes cells for increased fitness towards the corresponding environmental challenge. These findings suggest that functional transcript diversity acts as a mechanism that provides a selective advantage to individual cells within otherwise transcriptionally heterogeneous populations.},

Whereas the control of {mRNA} synthesis through transcription has been well characterized, less is known about the regulation of {mRNA} turnover, and a consensus model explaining the wide variations in {mRNA} decay rates remains elusive. Here, we combine non-invasive transcriptome-wide {mRNA} production and stability measurements with selective and acute perturbations to demonstrate that {mRNA} degradation is tightly coupled to the regulation of translation, and that a competition between translation initiation and {mRNA} decay-but not codon optimality or elongation-is the major determinant of {mRNA} stability in yeast. Our refined measurements also reveal a remarkably dynamic transcriptome with an average {mRNA} half-life of only 4.8 min-much shorter than previously thought. Furthermore, global {mRNA} destabilization by inhibition of translation initiation induces a dose-dependent formation of processing bodies in which {mRNA}s can decay over time.},

   abstract = {{mRNA} degradation represents a critical regulated step in gene expression. Although the major pathways in turnover have been identified, accounting for disparate half-lives has been elusive. We show that codon optimality is one feature that contributes greatly to {mRNA} stability. Genome-wide RNA decay analysis revealed that stable {mRNA}s are enriched in codons designated optimal, whereas unstable {mRNA}s contain predominately non-optimal codons. Substitution of optimal codons with synonymous, non-optimal codons results in dramatic {mRNA} destabilization, whereas the converse substitution significantly increases stability. Further, we demonstrate that codon optimality impacts ribosome translocation, connecting the processes of translation elongation and decay through codon optimality. Finally, we show that optimal codon content accounts for the similar stabilities observed in {mRNA}s encoding proteins with coordinated physiological function. This work demonstrates that codon optimization exists as a mechanism to finely tune levels of {mRNA}s and, ultimately, proteins.},

This localization requires four cis-acting localization elements located in the ASH1 {mRNA}, five trans-acting factors, one of which is a myosin, and the actin cytoskeleton. The RNA-binding proteins that interact with these cis-elements remained to be identified. Starting with the 3′ most localization element of ASH1 {mRNA} in the three-hybrid assay, element E3, we isolated a clone corresponding to the C-terminus of She3p. We also found that She3p and She2p interact, and this interaction is essential for the binding of She3p with element E3 in vivo. Moreover, She2p was observed to bind the E3 RNA directly in vitro and each of the ASH1 cis-acting localization elements requires She2p for their localization function. By tethering a She3p–MS2 fusion protein to a reporter RNA containing MS2 binding sites, we observed that She2p is dispensable for She3p–MS2-dependent RNA localization.},

   abstract = {Transcript function is determined by sequence elements arranged on an individual RNA molecule. Variation in transcripts can affect messenger RNA stability, localization and translation, or produce truncated proteins that differ in localization or function. Given the existence of overlapping, variable transcript isoforms, determining the functional impact of the transcriptome requires identification of full-length transcripts, rather than just the genomic regions that are transcribed. Here, by jointly determining both transcript ends for millions of RNA molecules, we reveal an extensive layer of isoform diversity previously hidden among overlapping RNA molecules. Variation in transcript boundaries seems to be the rule rather than the exception, even within a single population of yeast cells. Over 26 major transcript isoforms per protein-coding gene were expressed in yeast. Hundreds of short coding RNAs and truncated versions of proteins are concomitantly encoded by alternative transcript isoforms, increasing protein diversity. In addition, approximately 70% of genes express alternative isoforms that vary in post-transcriptional regulatory elements, and tandem genes frequently produce overlapping or even bicistronic transcripts. This extensive transcript diversity is generated by a relatively simple eukaryotic genome with limited splicing, and within a genetically homogeneous population of cells. Our findings have implications for genome compaction, evolution and phenotypic diversity between single cells. These data also indicate that isoform diversity as well as RNA abundance should be considered when assessing the functional repertoire of genomes. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, intensive computational efforts have been directed towards the discovery of promoter motifs that correlate with {mRNA} expression profiles. Nevertheless, it is still not always possible to predict steady-state {mRNA} expression levels based on promoter signals alone, suggesting that other factors may be involved. Other genic regions, in particular 3' UTRs, which are known to exert regulatory effects especially through controlling RNA stability and localization, were less comprehensively investigated, and deciphering regulatory motifs within them is thus crucial. RESULTS: By analyzing 3' UTR sequences and {mRNA} decay profiles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, we derived a catalog of 53 sequence motifs that may be implicated in stabilization or destabilization of {mRNA}s. Some of the motifs correspond to known RNA-binding protein sites, and one of them may act in destabilization of ribosome biogenesis genes during stress response. In addition, we present for the first time a catalog of 23 motifs associated with subcellular localization. A significant proportion of the 3' UTR motifs is highly conserved in orthologous yeast genes, and some of the motifs are strikingly similar to recently published mammalian 3' UTR motifs. We classified all genes into those regulated only at transcription initiation level, only at degradation level, and those regulated by a combination of both. Interestingly, different biological functionalities and expression patterns correspond to such classification. CONCLUSION: The present motif catalogs are a first step towards the understanding of the regulation of {mRNA} degradation and subcellular localization, two important processes which--together with transcription regulation--determine the cell transcriptome.},

   abstract = {The terminator regions of eukaryotes encode functional elements in the 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR) that influence the 3′-end processing of {mRNA}, {mRNA} stability, and translational efficiency, which can modulate protein production. However, the contribution of these terminator regions to gene expression remains unclear, and therefore their utilization in metabolic engineering or synthetic genetic circuits has been limited. Here, we comprehensively evaluated the activity of 5302 terminator regions from a total of 5880 genes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by inserting each terminator region downstream of the PTDH3- green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene and measuring the fluorescent intensity of GFP. Terminator region activities relative to that of the PGK1 standard terminator ranged from 0.036 to 2.52, with a mean of 0.87. We thus could isolate the most and least active terminator regions. The activities of the terminator regions showed a positive correlation with {mRNA} abundance, indicating that the terminator region is a determinant of {mRNA} abundance. The least active terminator regions tended to encode longer 3′-UTRs, suggesting the existence of active degradation mechanisms for those {mRNA}s. The terminator regions of ribosomal protein genes tended to be the most active, suggesting the existence of a common regulator of those genes.

abstract = {Abstract Terminators in eukaryotes play an important role in regulating the transcription process by influencing {mRNA} stability, translational efficiency, and localization. Herein, the strengths of 100 natural terminators in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been characterized by inserting each terminator downstream of the TYS1p-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter gene and measuring the fluorescent intensity (FI) of eGFP. Within this library, there are 45 strong terminators, 31 moderate terminators, and 24 weak terminators. The strength of these terminators, relative to that of PGK1t standard terminator, ranges from 0.0613 to 1.8002, with a mean relative FI of 0.9945. Mutating the control elements of terminators further suggests that the efficiency element has an important effect on terminator strength. The use of strong terminators will result in an enhanced level of {mRNA} and protein production; this indicates that gene expression can be directly influenced by terminator selection. Pairing a terminator with an inducible promoter or a strong constitutive promoter has less effect on gene expression; however, pairing with a week promoter will significantly increase the level of gene expression. Through exchange of the reporter genes, it can be demonstrated that the terminator functions as a genetic component and is independent of the coding region. This work demonstrates that the terminator is an important regulatory element and can be considered in applications for the fine-tuning of gene expression and metabolic pathways.},

We recently identified five strong terminator regions (RPL41Bt, RPL15At, DIT1t, RPL3t, and IDP1t) in a comprehensive analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The effect of the terminator regions was analyzed by measuring the protein production of a linked transgene, and was shown to be twice that of a traditional terminator region (PGK1t). Here, we investigated whether the activity of the terminator regions is affected by exchange of a strong promoter or reporter in the linked transgene, carbon source for cell growth, stress factors, host yeast strain, or stage of the growth phase. Our results indicate that the activities of all five terminator regions were twice that of PGK1t in all conditions tested. In addition, we demonstrated that the strong activity of these terminator regions could be used to improve secretory production of endoglucanase II derived from Tricoderma ressei, and that the DIT1t strain was the best of the five strains for this purpose. We therefore propose that DIT1t, and the four other terminator regions, could be applied to the development of improved metabolically engineered yeasts.}

   abstract = {Biology is encoded in molecular sequences: deciphering this encoding remains a grand scientific challenge. Functional regions of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences often exhibit characteristic but subtle motifs; thus, computational discovery of motifs in sequences is a fundamental and much-studied problem. However, most current algorithms do not allow for insertions or deletions (indels) within motifs, and the few that do have other limitations. We present a method, GLAM2 (Gapped Local Alignment of Motifs), for discovering motifs allowing indels in a fully general manner, and a companion method GLAM2SCAN for searching sequence databases using such motifs. GLAM2 is a generalization of the gapless Gibbs sampling algorithm. It re-discovers variable-width protein motifs from the PROSITE database significantly more accurately than the alternative methods PRATT and SAM-T2K. Furthermore, it usefully refines protein motifs from the ELM database: in some cases, the refined motifs make orders of magnitude fewer overpredictions than the original ELM regular expressions. GLAM2 performs respectably on the BAliBASE multiple alignment benchmark, and may be superior to leading multiple alignment methods for "motif-like" alignments with N- and C-terminal extensions. Finally, we demonstrate the use of GLAM2 to discover protein kinase substrate motifs and a gapped DNA motif for the LIM-only transcriptional regulatory complex: using GLAM2SCAN, we identify promising targets for the latter. GLAM2 is especially promising for short protein motifs, and it should improve our ability to identify the protein cleavage sites, interaction sites, post-translational modification attachment sites, etc., that underlie much of biology. It may be equally useful for arbitrarily gapped motifs in DNA and RNA, although fewer examples of such motifs are known at present.

In yeast, Puf3p binds the 3′ UTR of COX17 {mRNA} and promotes rapid deadenylation and decay. We have investigated the sequences required for Puf3p recruitment to this 3′ UTR and have identified two separate binding sites. These sites are specific for Puf3p, as they cannot bind another Puf protein, Puf5p. Both sites use a conserved UGUANAUA sequence, whereas one site contains additional sequences that enhance binding affinity. In vivo, presence of either site partially stimulates COX17 {mRNA} decay, but full decay regulation requires the presence of both sites. No other sequences outside the 3′ UTR are required to mediate this decay regulation. The Puf repeat domain of Puf3p is sufficient not only for in vitro binding to the 3′ UTR, but also in vivo stimulation of COX17 {mRNA} decay. These experiments indicate that the essential residues involved in {mRNA} decay regulation are wholly contained within this RNA-binding domain.},

Here we present the crystal structure of Ssd1 at 1.9 {\r A} resolution. Active RNase II enzymes have a characteristic, internal RNA binding path, but in Ssd1 this is blocked by remnants of regulatory sequences. Instead, RNA binding activity has likely been relocated to the outer surface of the protein. Using in vivo crosslinking and cDNA analysis (CRAC), we identify Ssd1-RNA binding sites. These are strongly enriched in 5{\textquoteright}UTRs of a subset of {mRNA}s encoding cell wall proteins. Based on these and previous analyses, we identified a conserved bipartite motif that binds Ssd1 with high affinity in vitro.

   abstract = {Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) are random oligonucleotide barcodes that are increasingly used in high-throughput sequencing experiments. Through a UMI, identical copies arising from distinct molecules can be distinguished from those arising through PCR amplification of the same molecule. However, bioinformatic methods to leverage the information from UMIs have yet to be formalized. In particular, sequencing errors in the UMI sequence are often ignored or else resolved in an ad hoc manner. We show that errors in the UMI sequence are common and introduce network-based methods to account for these errors when identifying PCR duplicates. Using these methods, we demonstrate improved quantification accuracy both under simulated conditions and real iCLIP and single-cell RNA-seq data sets. Reproducibility between iCLIP replicates and single-cell RNA-seq clustering are both improved using our proposed network-based method, demonstrating the value of properly accounting for errors in UMIs. These methods are implemented in the open source UMI-tools software package.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing webbased methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner. Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

Recent experimental high-throughput techniques, such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) provide important information about the architecture of the regulatory networks in the cell. However, it is very difficult to measure the concentration levels of transcription factor proteins and determine their regulatory effect on gene transcription. It is therefore an important computational challenge to infer these quantities using gene expression data and network architecture data.Results: We develop a probabilistic state space model that allows genome-wide inference of both transcription factor protein concentrations and their effect on the transcription rates of each target gene from microarray data. We use variational inference techniques to learn the model parameters and perform posterior inference of protein concentrations and regulatory strengths. The probabilistic nature of the model also means that we can associate credibility intervals to our estimates, as well as providing a tool to detect which binding events lead to significant regulation. We demonstrate our model on artificial data and on two yeast datasets in which the network structure has previously been obtained using ChIP data. Predictions from our model are consistent with the underlying biology and offer novel quantitative insights into the regulatory structure of the yeast cell.Availability: MATLAB code is available from Contact:guido@dcs.shef.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary Data are available at Bioinformatics online}",

Uncovering these genome-scale interactions constitutes a major bottleneck in systems biology. Sparse latent factor models, assuming activity of transcription factors (TFs) as unobserved, provide a biologically interpretable modelling framework, integrating gene expression and genome-wide binding data, but at the same time pose a hard computational inference problem. Existing probabilistic inference methods for such models rely on subjective filtering and suffer from scalability issues, thus are not well-suited for realistic genome-scale applications.We present a fast Bayesian sparse factor model, which takes input gene expression and binding sites data, either from ChIP-seq experiments or motif predictions, and outputs active TF-gene links as well as latent TF activities. Our method employs an efficient variational Bayes scheme for model inference enabling its application to large datasets which was not feasible with existing MCMC-based inference methods for such models. We validate our method on synthetic data against a similar model in the literature, employing MCMC for inference, and obtain comparable results with a small fraction of the computational time. We also apply our method to large-scale data from Mycobacterium tuberculosis involving ChIP-seq data on 113 TFs and matched gene expression data for 3863 putative target genes.

   abstract = {Several of the thousands of human long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been functionally characterized; however, potential roles for lncRNAs in somatic tissue differentiation remain poorly understood. Here we show that a 3.7-kilobase lncRNA, terminal differentiation-induced ncRNA (TINCR), controls human epidermal differentiation by a post-transcriptional mechanism. TINCR is required for high messenger RNA abundance of key differentiation genes, many of which are mutated in human skin diseases, including FLG, LOR, ALOXE3, ALOX12B, ABCA12, CASP14 and ELOVL3. TINCR-deficient epidermis lacked terminal differentiation ultrastructure, including keratohyalin granules and intact lamellar bodies. Genome-scale RNA interactome analysis revealed that TINCR interacts with a range of differentiation {mRNA}s. TINCR-{mRNA} interaction occurs through a 25-nucleotide 'TINCR box' motif that is strongly enriched in interacting {mRNA}s and required for TINCR binding. A high-throughput screen to analyse TINCR binding capacity to approximately 9,400 human recombinant proteins revealed direct binding of TINCR RNA to the staufen1 (STAU1) protein. STAU1-deficient tissue recapitulated the impaired differentiation seen with TINCR depletion. Loss of UPF1 and UPF2, both of which are required for STAU1-mediated RNA decay, however, did not have differentiation effects. Instead, the TINCR-STAU1 complex seems to mediate stabilization of differentiation {mRNA}s, such as KRT80. These data identify TINCR as a key lncRNA required for somatic tissue differentiation, which occurs through lncRNA binding to differentiation {mRNA}s to ensure their expression. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

   abstract = {Control of gene and protein expression of both endogenous and heterologous genes is a key component of metabolic engineering. While a large amount of work has been published characterizing promoters for this purpose, less effort has been exerted to elucidate the role of terminators in yeast. In this study, we characterize over 30 terminators for use in metabolic engineering applications in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determine {mRNA} half-life changes to be the major cause of the varied protein and transcript expression level. We demonstrate that the difference in transcript level can be over 6.5-fold even for high strength promoters. The influence of terminator selection is magnified when coupled with a low-expression promoter, with a maximum difference in protein expression of 11-fold between an expression-enhancing terminator and the parent plasmid terminator and over 35-fold difference when compared with a no-terminator baseline. This is the first time that terminators have been investigated in the context of multiple promoters spanning orders of magnitude in activity. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of terminator selection for metabolic engineering by using a mutant xylose isomerase gene as a proof-of-concept. Through pairing an expression-enhancing terminator with a low-expression promoter, we were able to achieve the same phenotypic result as with a promoter considerably higher in strength. Moreover, we can further boost the phenotype of the high-strength promoter by pairing it with an expression-enhancing terminator. This work highlights how terminator elements can be used to control metabolic pathways in the same way that promoters are traditionally used in yeast. Together, this work demonstrates that terminators will be an important part of heterologous gene expression and metabolic engineering for yeast in the future. © 2013 Elsevier Inc..},

To address this problem, binding sites for the snoRNP proteins Nop1, Nop56, Nop58, and Rrp9 were mapped by UV cross-linking and analysis of cDNAs. Cross-linked protein-RNA complexes were purified under highly-denaturing conditions, ensuring that only direct interactions were detected. Recovered RNA fragments were amplified after linker ligation and cDNA synthesis. Cross-linking was successfully performed either in vitro on purified complexes or in vivo in living cells. Cross-linking sites were precisely mapped either by Sanger sequencing of multiple cloned fragments or direct, high-throughput Solexa sequencing. Analysis of RNAs associated with the snoRNP proteins revealed remarkably high signal-to-noise ratios and identified specific binding sites for each of these proteins on the U3 RNA. The results were consistent with previous data, demonstrating the reliability of the method, but also provided insights into the architecture of the U3 snoRNP. The snoRNP proteins were also cross-linked to pre-rRNA fragments, with preferential association at known sites of box C/D snoRNA function. This finding demonstrates that the snoRNP proteins directly contact the pre-rRNA substrate, suggesting roles in snoRNA recruitment. The techniques reported here should be widely applicable to analyses of RNA-protein interactions.},

Advances in sequencing-based assays have enabled investigation of these processes genome-wide, leading to large datasets that combine information on the dynamics of gene expression, transcription factor binding and chromatin structure as cells differentiate. While numerous studies focus on the effects of these features on broader gene regulation, less work has been done on the mechanisms of gene-specific transcriptional control. In this study, we have focussed on the latter by integrating gene expression data for the in vitro differentiation of murine ES cells to macrophages and cardiomyocytes, with dynamic data on chromatin structure, epigenetics and transcription factor binding. Combining a novel strategy to identify communities of related control elements with a penalized regression approach, we developed individual models to identify the potential control elements predictive of the expression of each gene. Our models were compared to an existing method and evaluated using the existing literature and new experimental data from embryonic stem cell differentiation reporter assays. Our method is able to identify transcriptional control elements in a gene specific manner that reflect known regulatory relationships and to generate useful hypotheses for further testing.},

Using a simple model, we found that RNA and protein expression were within twofold of expected levels 80\% and 64\% of the time, respectively. The large dataset allowed quantitation of global effects, such as translation rate on {mRNA} stability and {mRNA} secondary structure on translation rate.

While 3’ end sequences contribute to expression differences through a variety of mechanisms including {mRNA} stability and regulation of translation, we find a predominant effect of {mRNA} 3’ end processing efficiency. Using extensive designed mutagenesis analysis we find that out of three functional elements described in the literature as comprising the polyadenylation signal, a single element (known as the efficiency element) is responsible for most of the effect on protein expression levels. Our work highlights the importance of 3’ end processing in expression regulation and facilitates the incorporation of the effect of this region into more complete models of DNA encoded gene expression regulation.},

A community-wide standard in DNA assembly would enable bio-molecular engineering at the levels of predictivity and universality in design and construction that are comparable to other engineering fields. Golden Gate Assembly technology, with its robust capability to unidirectionally assemble numerous DNA fragments in a one-tube reaction, has the potential to deliver a universal standard framework for DNA assembly. While current Golden Gate Assembly frameworks (e.g. MoClo and Golden Braid) render either high cloning capacity or vector toolkit simplicity, the technology can be made more versatile—simple, streamlined, and cost/labor-efficient, without compromising capacity. Here we report the development of a new Golden Gate Assembly framework named Mobius Assembly, which combines vector toolkit simplicity with high cloning capacity. It is based on a two-level, hierarchical approach and utilizes a low-frequency cutter to reduce domestication requirements. Mobius Assembly embraces the standard overhang designs designated by MoClo, Golden Braid, and Phytobricks and is largely compatible with already available Golden Gate part libraries. In addition, dropout cassettes encoding chromogenic proteins were implemented for cost-free visible cloning screening that color-code different cloning levels. As proofs of concept, we have successfully assembled up to 16 transcriptional units of various pigmentation genes in both operon and multigene arrangements. Taken together, Mobius Assembly delivers enhanced versatility and efficiency in DNA assembly, facilitating improved standardization and automation.},

   abstract = {Production of haploid gametes from diploid progenitor cells is mediated by a specialized cell division, meiosis, where two divisions, meiosis I and II, follow a single S phase. Errors in progression from meiosis I to meiosis II lead to aneuploid and polyploid gametes, but the regulatory mechanisms controlling this transition are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved kinase Ime2 regulates the timing and order of the meiotic divisions by controlling translation. Ime2 coordinates translational activation of a cluster of genes at the meiosis I-meiosis II transition, including the critical determinant of the meiotic chromosome segregation pattern CLB3. We further show that Ime2 mediates translational control through the meiosis-specific RNA-binding protein Rim4. Rim4 inhibits translation of CLB3 during meiosis I by interacting with the 59 untranslated region (UTR) of CLB3. At the onset of meiosis II, Ime2 kinase activity rises and triggers a decrease in Rim4 protein levels, thereby alleviating translational repression. Our results elucidate a novel developmentally regulated translational control pathway that establishes the meiotic chromosome segregation pattern. © 2013 Berchowitz et al.},

   abstract = {Localization of ASH1 {mRNA} to the distal cortex of daughter but not mother cells at the end of anaphase is responsible for the two cells' differential mating-type switching during the subsequent cell cycle. This localization depends on actin filaments and a type V myosin (She1/Myo4). The 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of ASH1 {mRNA} is reportedly capable of directing heterologous RNAs to a mother cell's bud [1,2]. Surprisingly, however, its replacement has little or no effect on the localisation of ASH1 {mRNA}. We show here that, unlike all other known localization sequences that have been found in 3' UTRs, all the elements involved in ASH1 {mRNA} localization are located at least partly within its coding region. A 77 nucleotide region stretching from 7 nucleotides 5' to 67 nucleotides 3' of the stop codon of {ASH1} {mRNA} is sufficient to localize {mRNA}s to buds; the secondary structure of this region, in particular two stems, is important for its localizing activity. Two regions entirely within coding sequences, both sufficient to localize green fluorescent protein (GFP) {mRNA} to growing buds, are necessary for ASH1 {mRNA} localization during anaphase. These three regions can anchor GFP {mRNA} to the distal cortex of daughter cells only inefficiently. The tight anchoring of ASH1 {mRNA} to the cortex of the daughter cell depends on translation of the carboxy-terminal sequences of Ash1 protein.},

   abstract = {The sorting of the Ash1 protein to the daughter nucleus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in late anaphase of the budding cycle correlates with the localization of ASH1 {mRNA} at the bud tip [1,2]. Although the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of ASH1 is sufficient to localize a reporter {mRNA}, it is not necessary, a result which indicates that other sequences are involved [1]. We report the identification of three additional cis-acting elements in the coding region. Each element alone, when fused to a lacZ reporter gene, was sufficient for the localization of the lacZ {mRNA} reporter to the bud. A fine-structure analysis of the 3' UTR element showed that its function in {mRNA} localization did not depend on a specific sequence but on the secondary and tertiary structure of a minimal 118 nucleotide stem-loop. Mutations in the stem-loop that affect the localization of the lacZ {mRNA} reporter also affected the formation of the localization particles, in living cells, composed of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) complexed with lacZ-ASH1-3' UTR {mRNA} [3]. A specific stem-loop in the 3' UTR of the ASH1 {mRNA} is therefore required for both localization and particle formation, suggesting that complex formation is part of the localization mechanism. An analysis on one of the coding-region elements revealed a comparable stem-loop structure with similar functional requirements.},

   abstract = {Spatial control of gene expression, at the level of both transcription and translation, is critical for cellular differentiation [1-4]. In budding yeast, the conserved Ndr/warts kinase Cbk1 localizes to the new daughter cell, where it acts as a cell fate determinant. Cbk1 both induces a daughter-specific transcriptional program and promotes morphogenesis in a less well-defined role [5-8]. Cbk1 is essential in cells expressing functional Ssd1, an RNA-binding protein of unknown function [9-11]. We show here that Cbk1 inhibits Ssd1 in vivo. Loss of this regulation dramatically slows bud expansion, leading to highly aberrant cell wall organization at the site of cell growth. Ssd1 associates with specific {mRNA}s, a significant number of which encode cell wall remodeling proteins. Translation of these messages is rapidly and specifically suppressed when Cbk1 is inhibited; this suppression requires Ssd1. Transcription of several of these Ssd1-associated {mRNA}s is also regulated by Cbk1, indicating that the kinase controls both the transcription and translation of daughter-specific {mRNA}s. This work suggests a novel system by which cells coordinate localized expression of genes involved in processes critical for cell growth and division. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We now report that the RNA binding protein Khd1 interacts with the ASH1 {mRNA} localization element E1 and with the C-terminal domain of eIF4G1 to regulate the translation of this transcript. Khd1p reduces translation initiation on the ASH1 {mRNA} and diminishes Ash1p leakage into the mother cell nucleus. Furthermore, we show that the casein kinase Yck1p phosphorylates Khd1p at the plasma membrane, disrupting the Khd1p-RNA complex and releasing its translational repression on the ASH1 {mRNA}.

Recent advances have helped to draw an increasingly clear picture on the molecular mechanisms governing ASH1 {mRNA} localization from its co-transcriptional birth to its delivery at the site of destination. These new insights help to better understand the requirement of initial nuclear mRNPs, the molecular basis of specific {mRNA}-cargo recognition via cis-acting RNA elements, the different stages of RNP biogenesis and reorganization, as well as activation of the motile activity upon cargo binding.

Our approach is based on Gaussian processes and applies to a wide range of data. In tests, the method is at least as accurate as others, but has several advantages: it estimates errors both in the inference and in any summary statistics, such as lag times, and allows interpolation with the corresponding error estimation. As illustrations, we infer growth rates of microbial cells, the rate of assembly of an amyloid fibril and both the speed and acceleration of two separating spindle pole bodies.

   abstract = {5PSeq is a method for studying ribosome dynamics based on co-translational mRNA decay. Genome-wide sequencing and quantification of 5′ phosphorylated mRNA degradation products allows the positions of the last translating ribosomes to be determined. Co-translational mRNA degradation is a widespread process in which 5′–3′ exonucleolytic degradation follows the last translating ribosome, thus producing an in vivo ribosomal footprint that delimits the 5′ position of the mRNA molecule within the ribosome. To study this degradation process and ribosome dynamics, we developed 5PSeq, which is a method that profiles the genome-wide abundance of mRNA degradation intermediates by virtue of their 5′-phosphorylated (5′P) ends. The approach involves targeted ligation of an oligonucleotide to the 5′P end of mRNA degradation intermediates, followed by depletion of rRNA molecules, reverse transcription of 5′P mRNAs and Illumina high-throughput sequencing. 5PSeq can identify translational pauses at rare codons that are often masked when using alternative methods. This approach can be applied to previously extracted RNA samples, and it is straightforward and does not require polyribosome purification or in vitro RNA footprinting. The protocol we describe here can be applied to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and potentially to other eukaryotic organisms. Three days are required to generate 5PSeq libraries.},
