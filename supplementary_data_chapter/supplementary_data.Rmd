## Motif effects on transcript expression is repeated in protein expression data

The effects of motif presence on protein expression was investigate with a platereader assay detecting the fluorescence of the mCherry reporter gene on the pRPS3-tRPS3 and pTSA1-tTSA1 constructs.
The right column in Figure \@ref(fig:protein-verse-RNA-plot) confirms that motif effects can be detected in protein expression expression alone.
Comparing the corresponding RNA abundance levels, left column of Figure \@ref(fig:protein-verse-RNA-plot), the same effects of the motifs on transcript abundance are seen in protein expression, together with the same context dependence. 

```{r protein-verse-RNA-plot, fig.cap="\\textbf{Motif contributions to protein abundance correlate with RNA abundance}. (\\textbf{Left}) Fold changes in mRNA abundance for all terminator constructs in the pRPS3-tRPS3 and pTSA1-tTSA1 pairings. (\\textbf{Right}) mCherry fluorescence at the maximum growth rate for all terminator constructs in the pRPS3-tRPS3 and pTSA1-tTSA1 pairings.", out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
