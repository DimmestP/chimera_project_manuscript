We have confirmed that promoter-terminator pairings change the effectiveness of each region's contribution to gene expression. This supports previous work by Curran et al. 2013 and  Wei et al. 2017 showing that promoter and terminator regions are not entirely modular when regulating gene expression. We explored whether the changes in regulatory behavior according to overall context is explained by changes in the regulatory effects of individual cis-regulatory elements within these regions. We have shown that 3'UTR sequence motifs, confirmed to to have a statistically significant contributions to transcript decay rates, have effects on gene expression that are dependent on overall terminator context and promoter pairing. Our results suggest that fold changes in overall gene expression due to poor promoter-terminator pairings are an order of magnitude lower than the selection of an optimal promoter alone. Although this implies promoter-terminator pairings will have minimal impact on the construction of genetic pathways, the implications for searching for novel cis-regulatory elements remain significant. The qPCR results for RPS3, TSA1 and PIR1 show motifs vary their contribution to gene expression, but further high-throughput results are required to confirm the extent to which this behavior is reflected across the genome. Nevertheless, these results cast doubt on whether future computational and experimental searches can continue to assume modularity if more complex regulatory elements are to be found.
