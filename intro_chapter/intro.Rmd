# Introduction

Our understanding of gene expression relies on the abstraction of a gene into discrete cis-regulatory elements (CRE), or parts, based on their most prominent function.
The promoter coordinates the initiation of transcription.
Transcription then progresses until it reaches the terminator, where cleavage and polyadenylation of the nascent RNA transcript is coordinated.
Extending the abstraction to the mature messenger RNA transcript, the coding sequence is flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) at its 5' and  3' ends.
The 5'UTR contributes to translation regulation and the 3'UTR contributes to transcript stability and localisation.
Assigning specific characteristics to individual elements of a gene has facilitated the assumption that parts are modular or interchangeable with other parts.
However, it is important to distinguish between two concepts of modularity: modular assembly, how easy it is to construct combinations of parts; and composability, how function and regulation can be decomposed into contributions from individual parts.

Modular assembly is now routine: modern DNA synthesis and cloning techniques allow the construction of complex gene pathways through the combinatorial assembly of chosen parts [@Curran2013; @Lee2015; @Garcia2018; @Andreou2018]. 
Several groups have constructed standardised libraries comprising promoter (including 5'UTR) and terminator (including 3'UTR) parts, which can be combined to achieve desired expression of synthesized proteins.
The characterisation of all possible promoter-terminator pairings is impractical, so standardised libraries generally characterise parts independently, for example testing many promoters with the same coding sequence and terminator [@Lee2015].
Similarly, even massively parallel approaches to characterise smaller CREs usually explore a large library of promoter elements with a single terminator [@Sharon2012], or conversely a library of promoters with a single terminator [@Shalem2015].
These experiments do not measure interactions between different parts and, therefore, an assumption of composability is required to extend their conclusions to other combinations of parts.

Computational methods for the discovery and quantification of short CREs, such as sequence motifs recognised by regulatory proteins, also tend to rely on models of independent effects, that is, composability.
Prominent methodologies for detecting CRE's include predicting functional data with short sequence features, often using linear models [@Shalgi2005; @Cheng2017; @Vijayabaskar2019]; or, directly comparing the sequences of genes with similar characteristics to determine the presence of short consensus sequence motifs [@Hogan2008; @Kretz2013] using motif discovery software [@Elemento2007; @Bailey2015].
Both these approaches make the implicit approximation that the contribution of a short CRE is independent of context, so that the effect of combining motifs is composed of a linear sum (on the appropriate scale) of the individual CRE contributions.
The approximation that short CREs act independently helps to find elements that have clear contributions, and to simplify a vast search space that would be made exponentially larger by accounting for CRE interactions.
However, framing the search for CREs around independent contributions from short motifs overlooks multi-part motifs, interactions between motifs, and the fact that motifs may be active only in specific contexts.

The importance of the interactions between CREs alone has been clear since the discovery of cooperative DNA binding by transcription factors [@Giniger1988].
For example, whether post-transcriptional regulatory CREs are functional or not depends on the RNA sequence context [@Taliaferro2016].
One large-scale study of synthetic combinations of bacterial promoters and ribosomal binding sites showed that expression was largely composed of independent contributions; 64% of constructs had protein expression levels with less than a 2-fold deviation from the predictions of a linear model without interactions [@Kosuri2013]. 
However, 5% of the constructs had, on average, a 13-fold deviation.
Another study of promoter-terminator swaps in budding yeast revealed 2-fold changes due to promoter-terminator interactions [@Ito2013], even though these CREs are separated by 700nt of coding sequence. 

Here, we provide further evidence for the importance of interactions between regulatory regions, and show the limitations of decomposing gene expression regulation into independent contributions from short CREs. 
First, we use modular cloning to construct 120 combinations of promoter (including 5'UTR), coding sequence, and terminator (including 3'UTR) modules, showing that the quantitative effect of terminators on protein production depends on both promoter and coding sequence.
We then investigate the effect of promoter and terminator context on the regulatory behaviour of short CREs in 3'UTRs.
In order to select suitable 3'UTR motifs, we adapt a method to computationally predict mRNA log2-half-life as a linear combination of codon usage and motif counts [@Cheng2017].
We then quantify the effect on mRNA and protein levels of selected 3'UTR motifs when inserted in, or removed from, diverse reporter genes.
Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of candidate decay motifs indeed results in a decrease in RNA abundance, however their quantitative contribution depends on the host 3'UTR and the paired promoter.
