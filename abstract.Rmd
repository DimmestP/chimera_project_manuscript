\begin{abstract}
Genes are commonly abstracted into a coding sequence and cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoter and terminator regions, and short sequence motifs within these regions. 
Modern cloning techniques allow easy assembly of synthetic genetic constructs from discrete cis-regulatory modules. 
However, it is unclear how much the contributions of CREs to gene expression depend on other CREs in the host gene. Using budding yeast, we probe the limitations of assuming composability, or independent effects, of distinct CREs. 
We confirm that the quantitative effect of a terminator on gene expression depends on both promoter and coding sequence. 
We explore whether individual cis-regulatory motifs within terminator regions display similar context dependence, focussing on putative motifs predicted to be bound by RNA binding proteins, inferred using transcriptome-wide datasets of mRNA decay. 
We then construct a library of diverse reporter genes, consisting of different combinations of motifs within various terminator contexts, paired with different promoters, to challenge the assumption of composability. 
Our results show  that the impact of motifs depend both on their host terminator, and also on the associated promoter sequence. 
Consequently, this emphasises the need for improved motif algorithms that include both local and global context effects, which in turn can aid researchers in more accurate predictions of gene expression activity when employing diverse CREs for the construction of synthetic genetic constructs.
