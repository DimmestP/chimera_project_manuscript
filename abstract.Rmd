\begin{abstract}
Genes are commonly abstracted into a coding sequence and cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoter and terminator regions, and short sequence motifs within those.
Modern cloning techniques allow easy assembly of synthetic genes from discrete cis-regulatory modules.
However, it is unclear how much the contributions of CREs to gene expression depend on other CREs in the host gene.
Using budding yeast, we probe the limitations of assuming composability, or independent effects, of distinct CREs.
We confirm that the quantitative effect of a terminator on gene expression depends on both promoter and coding sequence.
Next, we explore whether individual cis-regulatory motifs within terminator regions display similar context dependence.
We focus on suspected protein binding motifs in mRNA transcript 3'UTRs, inferred from transcriptome-wide datasets of mRNA decay.
Then we create reporter constructs with different combinations of inserted or removed motifs in 3 different terminator contexts, each expressed from 3 different promoters.
Our results show that the effects of short CREs depend both on their host terminator, and also on the paired promoter at the opposite end of the coding sequence.
Observations that the same CRE can regulate gene expression differently in different host genes suggests that complex regulatory patterns are ubiquitous and need to be accounted for in designing synthetic genes.
Our results emphasise the need for improved CRE search algorithms that include both local and global context effects.
