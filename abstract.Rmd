\begin{abstract}
The task of discovering determinates of gene expression has led to the abstraction of a gene into discrete modules, such as promoter, ORF and terminator.
The characterisation of a module often assumes that it contributes to gene expression independently of any other modules present the host gene.
Our study first highlights the limitations of the assumption of independence by swapping promoter-terminator pairs in S.cerevisiae and confirming non-linear effects on overall gene expression.
Next, we explore whether this context dependence behavior is replicated by individual cis-regulatory elements within terminator regions.
Focusing on suspected protein binding motifs in mRNA transcript 3'UTRs, we insert/remove  CREs into/from different promoter-terminator pairings.
Our results show that individual cis-regulatory elements are highly dependent on both the host terminator and the paired promoter.
The possibility that the same CRE can regulate gene expression differently in different host genes suggest complex regulatory patterns are more ubiquitous than currently assumed.
Meanwhile, the consequences for novel CREs searches emphasise the need for improved search algorithms that include local and global context effects.
