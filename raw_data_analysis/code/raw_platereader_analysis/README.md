## Folder Contents

### omniplate_platereader_analysis_code
Platereader analysis code created by the Swain Lab, also available at https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/pswain/omniplate.

### motif_context_dependence
Contains three folders, one each motif host native promoter-terminator pairing, with a jupyter notebook python script for analysing protein fluorescence. It produces the following files;

- raw_data_analysis/data/norm_platereader/motif_context_dependence/pPIR1-mCh-tPIR1/pPIR1-mCh-tPIR1_both_reps.csv

- raw_data_analysis/data/norm_platereader/motif_context_dependence/pTSA1-mCh-tTSA1/pTSA1-mCh-tTSA1_both_reps.csv

- raw_data_analysis/data/norm_platereader/motif_context_dependence/pRPS3-mCh-tRPS3/pRPS3-mCh-tRPS3_both_reps.csv

It also contains an Rmd file to plot the combined fluorescence data as see in supplementary_data_chapter/figures/RPS3_TSA1_PIR1_protein_and_RNA_plot.png

### promoter_terminator_swaps
Contains two folders, one for mCh and one for mTurq, both with six jupyter notebook python scripts for analysing promoter-terminator protein fluorescence (one for each of the six experimental replicates). It produces the corresponding csv files found in raw_data_analysis/data/norm_platereader/promoter_terminator_swaps/

There are also two Rmd files, one for mCh and one for mTurq, to plot the combined fluorescence data as see in;
