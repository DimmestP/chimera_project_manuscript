### raw_qpcr
Contains all the raw qpcr machine data for the 9 promoter-terminator pairings used to test motif context plus the short vs long terminator comparisions for SRO9 and RPS3.

### norm_qpcr
Contains all the qpcr data presented in this paper after passing through the tidyqpcr analysis package.

### raw_platereader
Contains all the raw protein flurescence data presented in this paper; pPIR1-mCh-pPIR1, pTSA1-mCh-tTSA1 and pRPS3-mCH-tRPS3  motif constructs as well as the promoter-terminator libraries for mCh and mTur.

### norm_platereader
Contains all the normalised files of the above raw data as analysised by the omniplate python script.

### half_life_data
Contains all the raw data required to run the linear model predicting half life from codon usage and 3'UTR motif counts.
