raw_qpcr folder contains all the raw qpcr machine data for the 9 promoter-terminator pairings used to test motif context plus the short vs long terminator comparisions for SRO9 and RPS3.

norm_qpcr folder contains all the qpcr data presented in this paper after passing through the tidyqpcr analysis package.

platereader folder contains all the raw protein flurescence data presented in this paper; pTSA1-mCh-tTSA1 and pRPS3-mCH-tRPS3  motif constructs as well as the promoter-terminator libraries for mCh and mTur.

half_life_data folder contains all the raw data required to run the linear model predicting half life from codon usage and 3'UTR motif counts.
