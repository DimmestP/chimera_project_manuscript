This folder contains normalised mRNA abundance for all tRPS3 and tTSA1 terminator motifs. It holds the abundance of each biorep of each construct, as a median of its technical replicates, and normalises by the mean value of the RPS3_ORF (genetically integrated), PGK1_ORF (genetically integrated) and the URA3_ORF (plasmid integrated) values.
