### motif_context_dependence

Contains three csv files, one for each host terminator, of normalised mRNA abundance for all motifs context dependence constructs. It holds the abundance of each biorep of each construct, as a median of its technical replicates, and normalises by the mean value of the RPS3_ORF (genetically integrated), PGK1_ORF (genetically integrated) and the URA3_ORF (plasmid integrated) values. Created by the associated analysis file in raw_data_analysis/code/raw_qpcr_analysis/motif_context_dependence.
