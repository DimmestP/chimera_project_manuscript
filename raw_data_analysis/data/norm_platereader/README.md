## Folder Contents

### motif_context_dependence
Contains three folders, one for each motif host promoter-terminator pair, with one csv file of normalised fluorescence per OD at max growth rate for each motif context dependence construct (the two experimental replicates are combined into one file). Created by the associated analysis file in raw_data_analysis/code/raw_platereader_analysis/motif_context_dependence.

### promoter_terminator_swaps
Contains two folders, one for mCh and one for mTurq, with six csv files of normalised fluorescence per OD at max growth rate for each promoter-terminator swap construct (Each csv file is one experimental replicate). Created by the associated analysis file in raw_data_analysis/code/raw_platereader_analysis/promoter_terminator_swaps.
